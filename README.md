# UFO ANAlYSIS

The purpose of this challenge is to able to display UFO Sightings in US. The purpose is to be able to show data in a nice organized table using HTML and Javascript. It will also allow users to be able to filter data based on the following fields: Date, City, State, Country and the Shape of the UFO.

This webpage now has the option to filter. The user can enter one or more filters. This will enable the user to view UFOs based on the following criterias: Date, City, State, Country and Shape. The user can enter the values in the filter input boxes and press enter to be able to see the results.

The image below displays the filter criterias:

## SUMMARY

The one issue with the webpage is that the user is not able to clear the values in the filter input boxes. 

Adding a clear button to this webpage will allow the user to clear all entries and be able to do a new search. 

Each of the input boxes also need to have a clear button, as there are cases where the user does not need to clear all the inputs.

Some of the input boxes need to be drop down boxes rather than free test field. This makes it easir for the user to select a value rather than recalling what filter values the table can take. As an example all countries listed in the table should be available to the user as a drop down list in the filter input box.
